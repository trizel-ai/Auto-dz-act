# Formal Reference Requests & Digital Traceability

---

## Request Intake Policy

Any researcher, institution, or organization wishing to associate AUTO DZ ACT with a specific theoretical or experimental context must:

1. **Submit a written request via email**
2. **Acknowledge theory-neutrality of the algorithm**
3. **Accept full responsibility for interpretation and results**
4. **Cite this repository as the authoritative source**

---

## Email Channel (Formal, Auditable)

**Purpose**: Documented, traceable authorization channel

Email correspondence constitutes a **digital reference artifact** and creates an auditable record of:
- Request date and context
- Acknowledged scope limitations
- Authorization status
- Attribution requirements

---

## Request Requirements

A formal request must include:

1. **Requester identification**:
   - Full name
   - Institutional affiliation (if applicable)
   - Contact information

2. **Usage context**:
   - Description of experimental or theoretical application
   - Expected outputs or publications
   - Timeline and scope

3. **Acknowledgment of constraints**:
   - AUTO DZ ACT is methodological only
   - No theoretical endorsement is implied
   - Results are requester's responsibility
   - This repository must be cited

4. **Commitment to proper attribution**:
   - Zenodo DOI citation (when applicable)
   - GitHub repository reference
   - Clear separation between algorithm definition and interpretation

---

## Authorization Status

- **Absence of written confirmation implies no authorization**
- Email responses create binding digital trace
- Unauthorized use violates scientific attribution norms

---

## External Use Requirements

Any external experimental use of AUTO DZ ACT must:

1. Be **explicitly requested** through the formal channel
2. **Acknowledge scope limits** in all publications
3. **Accept methodological (non-theoretical) status**
4. **Reference this GitHub repository** as the authoritative definition source
5. **Cite applicable Zenodo deposits** for specific versions

---

## Zenodo Deposit References

When using AUTO DZ ACT in external work:

- **Definition-only reference**: Cite the appropriate Zenodo deposit for the algorithm definition
- **Experimental applications**: May have separate Zenodo deposits (see PUBLICATIONS.md)
- All Zenodo deposits must reference this GitHub repository as the living definition source

---

## No Automated Platform

AUTO DZ ACT is **not** available as:
- An automated web service
- A real-time monitoring platform
- A data ingestion API
- A cloud-based validation system

All execution occurs through explicitly authorized, documented implementations.

---

## No Implicit Consent

Use of AUTO DZ ACT does **not** automatically grant:
- Permission to claim theoretical validation
- Authority to speak on behalf of the algorithm author
- Rights to create derivative theoretical claims
- Endorsement of specific physical theories

---

## No Silent Reuse

Reuse without proper citation and acknowledgment constitutes:
- Scientific misattribution
- Violation of Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 requirements
- Breach of academic integrity norms
