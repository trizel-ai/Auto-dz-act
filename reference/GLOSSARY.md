# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used in AUTO DZ ACT documentation.

## Core terms

**AUTO DZ ACT**  
Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions.
An experimental algorithm for epistemic state validation.

**Epistemic state**  
The status of knowledge or evidence regarding a claim, independent of physical reality.

**Theory-agnostic**  
Independent of any specific physical theory. Treats all theories as external input.

**Declared theoretical baseline**  
A user-specified physical model or theory used as comparison input to AUTO DZ ACT.

**Validation**  
In AUTO DZ ACT context: comparison between theoretical predictions and observations.
Does NOT mean "proving correct" or "endorsing."

## Epistemic state components

**E — Existence**  
Whether observational evidence corresponding to a claim exists.

**M — Measurability**  
Whether evidence can be quantified using declared methods.

**D — Discriminative power**  
Whether evidence distinguishes between competing hypotheses.

## Symbolic labels

**(0/0)**  
Undetermined state — insufficient evidence.

**(D0/DZ)**  
Transitional detection — marginal or emerging signal.

**(DZ)**  
Determined state — reproducible, measurable.

**(∞/∞)**  
Non-discriminative — evidence exists but cannot distinguish models.

**Note**: These are classification markers, not mathematical equations.

---

## Scope terms

**Definition-only repository**  
A repository containing only documentation and definitions, no executable code.

**Theory-neutral**  
No endorsement, preference, or dependency on any specific physical theory.

**Misattribution firewall**  
Policies preventing incorrect association between AUTO DZ ACT and specific theories.

**Formal authorization**  
Written permission required to associate AUTO DZ ACT with specific theoretical contexts.
