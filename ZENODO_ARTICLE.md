## Abstract

This document presents the authoritative definition of AUTO DZ ACT (Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions), a theory-neutral algorithmic framework for epistemic state validation of scientific claims. AUTO DZ ACT is a methodological tool designed to classify the epistemic status of observational claims through symbolic and logical comparison against declared theoretical baselines. This publication establishes AUTO DZ ACT as a definition-only reference that performs no execution, no data analysis, and no physical interpretation. The framework is independent of any specific physical theory and does not validate or invalidate theoretical models. This article is intended as a permanent, citable scientific reference suitable for long-term archival on Zenodo.

**Keywords**: epistemic validation, methodological framework, theory-neutral algorithm, symbolic classification, experimental logic, definition-only reference

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This article documents AUTO DZ ACT as a definition-only, theory-neutral scientific reference. The purpose of this publication is to establish a permanent, authoritative definition that can be cited in scientific literature and used as a methodological reference without ambiguity or theoretical bias.

AUTO DZ ACT is an experimental scientific algorithm designed to perform epistemic state validation of observational claims. It is explicitly and exclusively a methodological framework—not a physical theory, not a proof system, and not a validation mechanism for any specific theoretical model.

### 1.2 Repository Role

This documentation is derived from the GitHub repository `trizel-ai/Auto-dz-act`, which serves as the living, authoritative source for the AUTO DZ ACT definition. The repository:

- Defines the AUTO DZ ACT algorithm only
- Performs no execution, no data ingestion, and no scientific interpretation
- Serves as a citation-ready scientific reference
- Maintains strict theory-neutrality and methodological boundaries
- Provides reproducible validation procedures

This repository explicitly does NOT:
- Execute experiments
- Ingest or analyze data
- Validate or invalidate any physical theory
- Interpret experimental results
- Claim scientific authority over outcomes

All execution-level applications of AUTO DZ ACT occur outside this definition repository.

## 2. Terminology and Canonical Expansion

### 2.1 Name and Acronym

**AUTO DZ ACT** is the canonical designation for:

**Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions**

### 2.2 Component Meaning

The expansion carries the following methodological meanings:

- **AUTO** (Automated): Procedure-driven, reproducible validation workflow that follows explicit algorithmic steps without subjective interpretation.

- **DZ** (Detection of Zero-states): Explicit labeling of insufficient or zero-evidence conditions where observational data is absent, inadequate, or below detection thresholds.

- **ACT** (Anomalous Condition Transitions): Tracked changes between epistemic states over time, documenting how the classification status of a claim evolves as new evidence becomes available.

### 2.3 Methodological Disclaimer

This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory. The terminology describes procedural characteristics of the validation algorithm, not properties of physical reality or claims about natural phenomena.

---

## 3. Epistemic Role and Methodological Boundaries

### 3.1 Core Objective

AUTO DZ ACT addresses a single, well-defined question:

> *What is the epistemic status of a scientific claim, given available observations and declared comparison rules?*

The algorithm explicitly does NOT answer:
- Whether a theory is "true"
- Whether a phenomenon "exists physically"
- Whether one model is "better" than another
- Whether experimental results support or refute a theory

### 3.2 Epistemic State Model

AUTO DZ ACT classifies scientific claims using an ordered triplet:

**S = (E, M, D)**

Where:

- **E — Existence**: Is there observational evidence corresponding to the claim?
- **M — Measurability**: Can the evidence be quantified using declared instruments or methods?
- **D — Discriminative power**: Does the evidence distinguish between competing hypotheses or models?

This triplet defines the **epistemic state** of a claim, not its physical reality, theoretical correctness, or scientific value.

### 3.3 Theory-Agnostic Design

AUTO DZ ACT is theory-agnostic by design. It treats all theories as:
- External inputs
- User-declared baselines
- Non-authoritative references

No specific theory is embedded in the algorithm. The framework applies equally to any declared theoretical baseline, regardless of origin, author, popularity, or acceptance within the scientific community.

---

## 4. Formal Definition of the Algorithmic Framework

### 4.1 Symbolic State Labels

AUTO DZ ACT employs symbolic labels as classification markers. These symbols are not mathematical equations and carry no physical meaning. They serve exclusively as epistemic state identifiers:

- **(0/0)**: Undetermined — Insufficient evidence; the claim cannot be evaluated with available data.

- **(D0/DZ)**: Transitional detection — Marginal or emerging signal; evidence exists but is preliminary or requires confirmation.

- **(DZ)**: Determined — Reproducible, measurable state; evidence is sufficient and consistent.

- **(∞/∞)**: Non-discriminative — Evidence exists but cannot distinguish between competing models or hypotheses.

These symbols represent procedural classifications within the validation workflow, not assertions about physical states or theoretical predictions.

### 4.2 Mathematical Logic Scope

Any mathematical or symbolic logic employed in AUTO DZ ACT:

- Is experimental and comparative in nature
- Is methodological, not foundational
- Exists exclusively to ensure reproducibility and transparency of the validation procedure
- Proposes no new mathematics or physics

The mathematical framework serves as a notation system for epistemic classification, not as a model of physical phenomena.

### 4.3 Classification Methodology

AUTO DZ ACT performs validation through:

1. **Baseline declaration**: User specifies theoretical predictions or expected observational signatures.
2. **Evidence evaluation**: Available observational data is examined for correspondence with declared baselines.
3. **State assignment**: The claim is assigned an epistemic state label based on the (E, M, D) triplet evaluation.
4. **Transition tracking**: Changes in epistemic state over time are documented as new evidence becomes available.

This procedure is reproducible, transparent, and independent of the theoretical framework being evaluated.
