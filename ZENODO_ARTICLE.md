## Abstract

AUTO DZ ACT is an experimental scientific algorithm designed to perform epistemic state validation of observational claims through symbolic and logical comparison against declared theoretical baselines. AUTO DZ ACT is theory-agnostic by design. The algorithm answers a single question: *What is the epistemic status of a scientific claim, given available observations and declared comparison rules?* It does not answer whether a theory is "true", whether a phenomenon "exists physically", or whether one model is "better" than another. AUTO DZ ACT classifies claims using an ordered triplet S = (E, M, D), defining the epistemic state, not physical reality. This publication is an authoritative definition only and performs no execution, no data ingestion, and no scientific interpretation.

**Methodological disclaimer**: This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

**Keywords**: epistemic validation, experimental logic, symbolic classification, theory-neutral, definition-only

## 1. Definition

**AUTO DZ ACT**  
**Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions**

### 1.1 Canonical Expansion

- **AUTO** — Automated: procedure-driven, reproducible validation workflow
- **DZ** — Detection of Zero-states: explicit labeling of insufficient or zero-evidence conditions
- **ACT** — Anomalous Condition Transitions: tracked changes between epistemic states over time

**Methodological disclaimer**: This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

AUTO DZ ACT is **theory-agnostic** by design.

### 1.2 Core Objective

The algorithm answers a single question:

> *What is the epistemic status of a scientific claim, given available observations and declared comparison rules?*

It does NOT answer:
- whether a theory is "true"
- whether a phenomenon "exists physically"
- whether one model is "better" than another

### 1.3 Epistemic State Model

AUTO DZ ACT classifies claims using an ordered triplet:

**S = (E, M, D)**

Where:

- **E — Existence**: Is there observational evidence corresponding to the claim?
- **M — Measurability**: Can the evidence be quantified using declared instruments or methods?
- **D — Discriminative power**: Does the evidence distinguish between competing hypotheses or models?

This triplet defines the **epistemic state**, not physical reality.

### 1.4 Symbolic State Labels

AUTO DZ ACT uses symbolic labels as **classification markers**, not equations:

- **(0/0)**: Undetermined — insufficient evidence
- **(D0/DZ)**: Transitional detection — marginal or emerging signal
- **(DZ)**: Determined — reproducible, measurable state
- **(∞/∞)**: Non-discriminative — evidence exists but cannot distinguish models

These symbols carry **no physical meaning**.

### 1.5 Mathematical Logic (Scope)

Any mathematical or symbolic logic used in AUTO DZ ACT:

- is experimental and comparative
- is methodological, not foundational
- exists only to ensure reproducibility and transparency

No new mathematics or physics is proposed.

## 2. Scope Boundaries

### 2.1 What AUTO DZ ACT Is

AUTO DZ ACT is:
- an algorithmic methodology
- a validation framework
- a symbolic classification system

### 2.2 What AUTO DZ ACT Is NOT

AUTO DZ ACT is NOT:
- a physical theory
- a model of nature
- a proof system
- a governance mechanism

### 2.3 Explicit Exclusions

This repository does NOT:
- reference any named physical theory
- compare theories against each other
- publish experimental results
- host datasets
- run simulations or monitoring tasks

### 2.4 Theory-Neutral Enforcement

AUTO DZ ACT treats all theories as:
- external inputs
- user-declared baselines
- non-authoritative references

No theory is embedded in the algorithm.

### 2.5 Neutrality Clause

AUTO DZ ACT is independent of:
- the origin of a theory
- the author of a theory
- the popularity or acceptance of a theory

Any application of AUTO DZ ACT to a theory:
- does not imply endorsement
- does not imply validation
- does not imply co-authorship

Responsibility for interpretation lies entirely with the experimenter.

### 2.6 Misattribution Prevention

AUTO DZ ACT must NOT be cited as:
- evidence for a theory
- proof of correctness
- endorsement of any model

Violation of this boundary constitutes misuse.

## 3. Digital Traceability and Attribution

### 3.1 Formal Request Channel

All external use of AUTO DZ ACT requires:
- **Formal written request** via documented email channel
- **Explicit acknowledgment** of scope limitations
- **Digital trace** of authorization and attribution requirements

### 3.2 Attribution Requirements

External use must:
1. Cite the appropriate Zenodo DOI
2. Reference this GitHub repository
3. Clearly separate algorithm definition from experimental interpretation
4. Acknowledge methodological (non-theoretical) status

### 3.3 Execution Separation

Execution repositories may:
- apply AUTO DZ ACT
- generate results
- publish analyses

This repository may NOT.

## 4. Governance and Archival Policy

### 4.1 Branch Protection Requirements

The AUTO DZ ACT repository implements the following governance to ensure the v1.0 definition remains locked and protected against accidental or hostile modification:

**Required Rules**:

1. **Prevent force pushes** — Ensures commit history cannot be rewritten
2. **Prevent branch deletion** — Protects the main branch from accidental removal
3. **Require pull requests before merging** — All changes must go through PR review process
4. **Require at least one review** — Minimum one approval required

**Rationale**:

These protections serve to:
- Lock the v1.0 definition as a stable reference
- Prevent unauthorized modifications
- Maintain scientific integrity
- Ensure all changes are reviewed
- Preserve commit history for traceability

### 4.2 Zenodo Archival Policy

**Repository Roles**:
- **GitHub repository** (`trizel-ai/Auto-dz-act`): Living, authoritative definition source
- **Zenodo deposits**: Intentional, versioned, archival snapshots for permanent citation

**Publication Policy**:
- Zenodo releases are **curated and versioned**, not automatic
- Each Zenodo deposit represents a stable, reviewed reference snapshot
- GitHub remains the primary source for latest definitions and updates
- All Zenodo deposits must reference this GitHub repository

**No Auto-Publication**: This repository does **not** automatically publish every GitHub change to Zenodo. Zenodo releases are intentional milestones only.

### 4.3 Multilingual Availability

**English is the canonical reference language** for all AUTO DZ ACT documentation.

All other languages (Arabic, French, etc.) are **faithful translations only**, not reinterpretations.

**Translation Constraints**:

No translation may introduce:
- New claims
- New theoretical interpretations
- Renamed concepts
- Additional context beyond the original

**Conflict Resolution**: **In case of conflict between language versions, English prevails.**

**Platform Responsibilities**:

The TRIZEL-AI platform (https://trizel-ai.com/) is responsible for:
1. **Hosting** multilingual versions of all mandatory documents
2. **Maintaining** version synchronization with GitHub
3. **Displaying** clear version/commit references
4. **Ensuring** public accessibility without barriers
5. **Preventing** contradictions or unauthorized extensions
6. **Updating** translations when GitHub source changes

**In case of discrepancy**: **GitHub is authoritative.** If any webpage contradicts GitHub documentation, the GitHub version is correct and the webpage is in error.

## 5. Historical Provenance

AUTO DZ ACT was developed as an independent experimental algorithm for epistemic validation of scientific claims.

Its design goal was generality and neutrality.

Primary archival references are hosted on Zenodo and GitHub.

**Key principle**: Historical applications of AUTO DZ ACT do not define its scope. Only this repository defines the algorithm.
