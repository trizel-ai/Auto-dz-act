## Abstract

AUTO DZ ACT is an experimental scientific algorithm designed to perform epistemic state validation of observational claims through symbolic and logical comparison against declared theoretical baselines. This repository serves as the authoritative public reference for the algorithm definition. It is a definition-only repository that performs no execution, no data ingestion, and no scientific interpretation. The algorithm is theory-agnostic by design, providing a methodological framework for reproducible validation procedures. This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

## 1. Definition

**AUTO DZ ACT**  
**Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions**

### 1.1 Canonical Expansion

- **AUTO** — Automated: procedure-driven, reproducible validation workflow
- **DZ** — Detection of Zero-states: explicit labeling of insufficient or zero-evidence conditions
- **ACT** — Anomalous Condition Transitions: tracked changes between epistemic states over time

**Methodological disclaimer**: This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

### 1.2 Core Objective

The algorithm answers a single question:

> *What is the epistemic status of a scientific claim, given available observations and declared comparison rules?*

It does NOT answer:
- whether a theory is "true"
- whether a phenomenon "exists physically"
- whether one model is "better" than another

### 1.3 Epistemic State Model

AUTO DZ ACT classifies claims using an ordered triplet:

S = (E, M, D)

Where:

- **E — Existence**  
  Is there observational evidence corresponding to the claim?

- **M — Measurability**  
  Can the evidence be quantified using declared instruments or methods?

- **D — Discriminative power**  
  Does the evidence distinguish between competing hypotheses or models?

This triplet defines the **epistemic state**, not physical reality.

### 1.4 Symbolic State Labels

AUTO DZ ACT uses symbolic labels as **classification markers**, not equations:

- (0/0): Undetermined — insufficient evidence
- (D0/DZ): Transitional detection — marginal or emerging signal
- (DZ): Determined — reproducible, measurable state
- (∞/∞): Non-discriminative — evidence exists but cannot distinguish models

These symbols carry **no physical meaning**.

### 1.5 Mathematical Logic (Scope)

Any mathematical or symbolic logic used in AUTO DZ ACT:

- is experimental and comparative
- is methodological, not foundational
- exists only to ensure reproducibility and transparency

No new mathematics or physics is proposed.

## 2. Scope Boundaries

### 2.1 What AUTO DZ ACT IS

- ✓ An authoritative definition of the AUTO DZ ACT algorithm
- ✓ A documentation source for its epistemic validation methodology
- ✓ A citation-ready scientific reference
- ✓ A theory-neutral, methodological framework
- ✓ A reproducible validation procedure
- ✓ An algorithmic methodology
- ✓ A validation framework
- ✓ A symbolic classification system

### 2.2 What AUTO DZ ACT is NOT

- ✗ Not a physical theory
- ✗ Not a validator of any specific theory
- ✗ Not an execution or monitoring platform
- ✗ Not a data analysis system
- ✗ Not a proof system or governance mechanism
- ✗ Not an automated web service or API
- ✗ Not a model of nature

### 2.3 Repository Role

This repository defines AUTO DZ ACT only.

It does NOT:
- execute experiments
- ingest or analyze data
- validate or invalidate any physical theory
- interpret experimental results
- claim scientific authority over outcomes

All execution-level uses occur outside this repository.

### 2.4 Explicit Exclusions

This repository does NOT:

- reference any named physical theory
- compare theories against each other
- publish experimental results
- host datasets
- run simulations or monitoring tasks

### 2.5 Theory-Neutral Enforcement

AUTO DZ ACT treats all theories as:
- external inputs
- user-declared baselines
- non-authoritative references

No theory is embedded in the algorithm.

### 2.6 Neutrality Clause

AUTO DZ ACT is independent of:
- the origin of a theory
- the author of a theory
- the popularity or acceptance of a theory

Any application of AUTO DZ ACT to a theory:
- does not imply endorsement
- does not imply validation
- does not imply co-authorship

Responsibility for interpretation lies entirely with the experimenter.

### 2.7 Misattribution Prevention

AUTO DZ ACT must NOT be cited as:
- evidence for a theory
- proof of correctness
- endorsement of any model

Violation of this boundary constitutes misuse.

## 3. Governance and Immutability

### 3.1 Purpose

Governance and branch protection requirements ensure the v1.0 definition remains locked and protected against accidental or hostile modification.

### 3.2 Branch Protection Ruleset

**Repository administrators must configure the following branch protection ruleset:**

#### Ruleset Configuration

- **Ruleset name**: `main-definition-protection`
- **Enforcement status**: Enabled
- **Target branches**: `main`

#### Required Rules

The following rules must be enabled:

1. **Prevent force pushes**  
   - Ensures commit history cannot be rewritten

2. **Prevent branch deletion**  
   - Protects the main branch from accidental removal

3. **Require pull requests before merging**  
   - All changes must go through PR review process

4. **Require at least one review**  
   - Minimum one approval required (Copilot review allowed)

#### Bypass List

The following entities may bypass branch protection rules for administrative purposes:

- **Repository admin**: `abdelkader-omran`
- **GitHub Copilot**: For review purposes only (not for force push)

### 3.3 Rationale

These protections serve to:

- Lock the v1.0 definition as a stable reference
- Prevent unauthorized modifications
- Maintain scientific integrity
- Ensure all changes are reviewed
- Preserve commit history for traceability

### 3.4 Compliance

Once implemented, this ruleset ensures that:

- ✓ The main branch cannot be force-pushed
- ✓ The main branch cannot be deleted
- ✓ All changes require pull request review
- ✓ At least one approval is required before merge
- ✓ Authorized admins can override when necessary

## 4. Historical Provenance

### 4.1 Origin

AUTO DZ ACT was developed as an independent experimental algorithm for epistemic validation of scientific claims.

Its design goal was generality and neutrality.

### 4.2 Public Record

Primary archival references are hosted on Zenodo and GitHub.

### 4.3 Key Principle

Historical applications of AUTO DZ ACT do not define its scope. Only this repository defines the algorithm.

---

## 5. Publication and Citation Policy

### 5.1 Zenodo Archival Policy

#### Repository Roles

- **GitHub repository** (`trizel-ai/Auto-dz-act`): Living, authoritative definition source
- **Zenodo deposits**: Intentional, versioned, archival snapshots for permanent citation

#### Publication Policy

- Zenodo releases are **curated and versioned**, not automatic
- Each Zenodo deposit represents a stable, reviewed reference snapshot
- GitHub remains the primary source for latest definitions and updates
- All Zenodo deposits must reference this GitHub repository

#### No Auto-Publication

This repository does **not** automatically publish every GitHub change to Zenodo. Zenodo releases are intentional milestones only.

### 5.2 Digital Traceability Requirements

#### Formal Request Channel

All external use of AUTO DZ ACT requires:
- **Formal written request** via documented email channel
- **Explicit acknowledgment** of scope limitations
- **Digital trace** of authorization and attribution requirements

#### Attribution Requirements

External use must:
1. Cite the appropriate Zenodo DOI
2. Reference this GitHub repository
3. Clearly separate algorithm definition from experimental interpretation
4. Acknowledge methodological (non-theoretical) status

### 5.3 Multilingual Availability and Public Reference Requirement

#### Canonical Language Policy

**English is the canonical reference language** for all AUTO DZ ACT documentation.

All other languages (Arabic, French, etc.) are **faithful translations only**, not reinterpretations.

#### Translation Constraints

No translation may introduce:
- New claims
- New theoretical interpretations
- Renamed concepts
- Additional context beyond the original

#### Conflict Resolution

**In case of conflict between language versions, English prevails.**

#### Reference Coupling

**GitHub as canonical source**

- **GitHub repository**: `trizel-ai/Auto-dz-act`
- **Role**: Authoritative, version-controlled reference source
- **Precedence**: GitHub takes precedence over all other publications

The website https://trizel-ai.com/ must:

1. **Publish faithful representations** of GitHub documentation
2. **Maintain version alignment** with GitHub commits
3. **Never contradict** the GitHub definition
4. **Never extend** beyond what GitHub states
5. **Never reinterpret** the documented scope

In case of discrepancy, **GitHub is authoritative.**

#### Public Accessibility Mandate

**Access requirements**

- **All definition pages** must be publicly accessible
- **No authentication** required to view documentation
- **No paywalls** or registration barriers
- **Direct linking** must be supported

#### Scope Preservation in Translation

Multilingual publication does NOT:
- Alter the scope of AUTO DZ ACT
- Introduce theory-specific context
- Grant interpretative authority to translations
- Create new definitions or explanations
- Add cultural or contextual interpretations

Translations are **representational only** and must:

1. **Preserve strict neutrality** — no theory names in any language
2. **Maintain wording fidelity** — faithful to original meaning
3. **Use equivalent neutral terms** — no introduction of bias
4. **Keep symbolic notation unchanged** — (E, M, D), (DZ), etc.
5. **Preserve all disclaimers and warnings**
