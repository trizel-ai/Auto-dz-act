# Scope Boundaries & Non-Disclosure Statement

misattribution, or theoretical confusion.

---

## Explicit exclusions

This repository does NOT:

- reference any named physical theory
- compare theories against each other
- publish experimental results
- host datasets
- run simulations or monitoring tasks

---

## Theory-neutral enforcement

AUTO DZ ACT treats all theories as:
- external inputs
- user-declared baselines
- non-authoritative references

No theory is embedded in the algorithm.

## Misattribution prevention

AUTO DZ ACT must NOT be cited as:
- evidence for a theory
- proof of correctness
- endorsement of any model

Violation of this boundary constitutes misuse.
