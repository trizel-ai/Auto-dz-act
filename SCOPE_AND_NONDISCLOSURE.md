# Scope Boundaries & Non-Disclosure Statement

This document defines strict boundaries to prevent misuse,
misattribution, or theoretical confusion.

---

## Canonical Algorithm Expansion

**AUTO DZ ACT**  
**Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions**

With canonical meaning:
- **AUTO** — Automated: procedure-driven, reproducible validation workflow
- **DZ** — Detection of Zero-states: explicit labeling of insufficient or zero-evidence conditions
- **ACT** — Anomalous Condition Transitions: tracked changes between epistemic states over time

**Methodological disclaimer**:  
This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

---

## Explicit exclusions

This repository does NOT:

- reference any named physical theory
- compare theories against each other
- publish experimental results
- host datasets
- run simulations or monitoring tasks

---

## Theory-neutral enforcement

AUTO DZ ACT treats all theories as:
- external inputs
- user-declared baselines
- non-authoritative references

No theory is embedded in the algorithm.

---

## Misattribution prevention

AUTO DZ ACT must NOT be cited as:
- evidence for a theory
- proof of correctness
- endorsement of any model

Violation of this boundary constitutes misuse.

---

## Digital Traceability Requirements

### Formal Request Channel

All external use of AUTO DZ ACT requires:
- **Formal written request** via documented email channel
- **Explicit acknowledgment** of scope limitations
- **Digital trace** of authorization and attribution requirements

See [reference/REFERENCE_REQUESTS.md](reference/REFERENCE_REQUESTS.md) for complete policy.

### Zenodo Archival Policy

- **GitHub repository** is the living, authoritative definition source
- **Zenodo deposits** are intentional, versioned, archival snapshots
- All Zenodo deposits must reference this GitHub repository
- No automated publication from GitHub to Zenodo

### Attribution Requirements

External use must:
1. Cite the appropriate Zenodo DOI
2. Reference this GitHub repository
3. Clearly separate algorithm definition from experimental interpretation
4. Acknowledge methodological (non-theoretical) status

---

## Execution separation

Execution repositories may:
- apply AUTO DZ ACT
- generate results
- publish analyses

This repository may NOT.
