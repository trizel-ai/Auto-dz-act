## Repository role (non-negotiable)

This repository defines AUTO DZ ACT only.

It does NOT:
- execute experiments
- ingest or analyze data
- validate or invalidate any physical theory
- interpret experimental results
- claim scientific authority over outcomes

All execution-level uses occur outside this repository.

## Definition

**AUTO DZ ACT**  
**Automated Detection of Zero-states and Anomalous Condition Transitions**

AUTO DZ ACT is an **experimental scientific algorithm** designed to perform
**epistemic state validation** of observational claims
through symbolic and logical comparison against declared theoretical baselines.

### Canonical Expansion

- **AUTO** — Automated: procedure-driven, reproducible validation workflow
- **DZ** — Detection of Zero-states: explicit labeling of insufficient or zero-evidence conditions
- **ACT** — Anomalous Condition Transitions: tracked changes between epistemic states over time

**Methodological disclaimer**: This designation is methodological and does not assert or imply any physical theory.

AUTO DZ ACT is **theory-agnostic** by design.

---

## Core objective

The algorithm answers a single question:

> *What is the epistemic status of a scientific claim, given available observations and declared comparison rules?*

It does NOT answer:
- whether a theory is "true"
- whether a phenomenon "exists physically"
- whether one model is "better" than another

---

## Epistemic state model

AUTO DZ ACT classifies claims using an ordered triplet:

S = (E, M, D)

Where:

- **E — Existence**  
  Is there observational evidence corresponding to the claim?

- **M — Measurability**  
  Can the evidence be quantified using declared instruments or methods?

- **D — Discriminative power**  
  Does the evidence distinguish between competing hypotheses or models?

This triplet defines the **epistemic state**, not physical reality.

---

## Symbolic state labels

AUTO DZ ACT uses symbolic labels as **classification markers**, not equations:

- (0/0): Undetermined — insufficient evidence
- (D0/DZ): Transitional detection — marginal or emerging signal
- (DZ): Determined — reproducible, measurable state
- (∞/∞): Non-discriminative — evidence exists but cannot distinguish models

These symbols carry **no physical meaning**.

---

## Mathematical logic (scope)

Any mathematical or symbolic logic used in AUTO DZ ACT:

- is experimental and comparative
- is methodological, not foundational
- exists only to ensure reproducibility and transparency

No new mathematics or physics is proposed.

---

## Scope boundaries

AUTO DZ ACT is:

- an algorithmic methodology
- a validation framework
- a symbolic classification system

AUTO DZ ACT is NOT:

- a physical theory
- a model of nature
- a proof system
- a governance mechanism

---

## Neutrality clause

AUTO DZ ACT is independent of:
- the origin of a theory
- the author of a theory
- the popularity or acceptance of a theory

Any application of AUTO DZ ACT to a theory:
- does not imply endorsement
- does not imply validation
- does not imply co-authorship

Responsibility for interpretation lies entirely with the experimenter.
