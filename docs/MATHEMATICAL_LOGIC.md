# Mathematical Logic

This document describes the symbolic and mathematical framework
used in AUTO DZ ACT for epistemic state classification.

---

## Status and scope

The mathematical logic in AUTO DZ ACT is:
- **Methodological**, not foundational
- **Comparative**, not predictive
- **Experimental**, not axiomatic

No new mathematics or physics is proposed.

## Epistemic state triplet

AUTO DZ ACT uses an ordered triplet to classify claims:

**S = (E, M, D)**

Where:
- **E** ∈ {0, 1} — Evidence existence
- **M** ∈ {0, 1} — Measurability status
- **D** ∈ {0, 1} — Discriminative power

This defines an epistemic state, not a physical state.

---

## State transitions

State transitions occur when observational input changes:

**(0, 0, 0) → (1, 0, 0)** — Evidence emerges  
**(1, 0, 0) → (1, 1, 0)** — Evidence becomes measurable  
**(1, 1, 0) → (1, 1, 1)** — Evidence becomes discriminative

Transitions are **observational**, not physical processes.

## Symbolic classification

AUTO DZ ACT maps epistemic states to symbolic labels:

| State     | Symbol  | Meaning                          |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------|
| (0, 0, 0) | (0/0)   | Undetermined                     |
| (1, 0, 0) | (D0/DZ) | Transitional detection           |
| (1, 1, 0) | (∞/∞)   | Non-discriminative               |
| (1, 1, 1) | (DZ)    | Determined                       |

**Important**: These symbols are classification markers, not equations.

## Comparison logic

AUTO DZ ACT compares:
1. Theoretical predictions (from user-declared baseline)
2. Observational data (from external measurements)

Using:
- Statistical deviation metrics
- Confidence intervals
- Consistency thresholds (user-defined or standard)

Output: A structured report of alignment or discrepancy.

---

## Neutrality constraint

All mathematical operations preserve theory-neutrality:
- No theory is privileged
- No interpretation is imposed
- Results are descriptive, not prescriptive

The experimenter owns all interpretations.

---

## Reproducibility

The mathematical logic is documented to ensure:
- Transparent comparison methods
- Reproducible classification
- Verifiable consistency checks

No proprietary or hidden logic is used.
